# DIY Lab - Obstacle-Avoiding Robot

The DIY Lab Obstacle-Avoiding Robot is a course project that involves constructing a robot using Arduino and implementing obstacle avoidance functionality. The robot is equipped with ultrasonic sensors to measure distances from obstacles, allowing it to navigate and avoid collisions. Additionally, the robot incorporates Bluetooth and voice control functionality, enabling users to control it wirelessly using their voice.

## Features

- Obstacle-avoiding robot constructed using Arduino and C++
- Utilizes ultrasonic sensors to measure distances from obstacles
- Enables the robot to navigate and avoid collisions
- Incorporates Bluetooth functionality for wireless communication
- Implements voice control functionality for easy and hands-free operation

## Usage

1. Assemble the robot hardware components according to the provided instructions.

2. Connect the ultrasonic sensors and Bluetooth module to the Arduino board following the wiring diagram.

3. Install the Arduino IDE on your computer and open the Arduino sketch (.ino) file provided in the project.

4. Upload the sketch to the Arduino board.

5. Power on the robot and ensure that the ultrasonic sensors are properly detecting obstacles.

6. Install a Bluetooth terminal app on your smartphone or computer.

7. Pair your smartphone or computer with the Bluetooth module on the robot.

8. Launch the Bluetooth terminal app and establish a connection with the robot.

9. Speak voice commands supported by the robot (e.g., "forward," "backward," "left," "right") into the microphone of your smartphone or computer.

10. The robot should respond to your voice commands and move accordingly, avoiding obstacles in its path.
